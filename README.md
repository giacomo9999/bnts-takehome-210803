Two-page site that performs API calls to determine the available routes and also loads the content.  

I got everything working that was specifed in the brief, except for A) implementing a redirect on a failing API request and B) loading a placeholder when an image file is missing. There just wasn't enough time. When I have a few hours free, I fully intend to go back and finish those up.  

Also, because the recursive nature of the JSON data made it a bit tricky to assign sequential keys, the "key" properties in the React component tree are (temporarily) random four-digit integers.  Again, when I have some time to go back and give it some thought I will go bck and implement a less-ridiculous approach.
